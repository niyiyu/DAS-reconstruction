## Requirements
All codes are implemented in PyTorch (https://pytorch.org). One NVidia A100 GPU is used for all tests. Codes are not tested on MacBook Pro with M1 chips.

## Talks
A slide from the final project at [ESS-590C-Fall22](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-Autumn22) is available [here](./docs/DASNIR_ESS590C.pdf).
