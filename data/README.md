## Retrieve earthquake data from Cook Inlet DAS experiment

The earthquake data from the Cook Inlet DAS experiment are available at [https://dasway.ess.washington.edu/gci/index.html](https://dasway.ess.washington.edu/gci/index.html). Events are updated daily.

Due to the huge size of the data used in this study, we cannot upload it directly in this repository. However, we prepared a Python script to download these data from our archival server. Please refer to [download.py](./download.py) in this directory.
